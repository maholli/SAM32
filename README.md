## New to Microcontrollers? No Problem!

**You can control this board with python or arduino! A basic text-editor is all you need to get started.**

* to learn more about interacting with microcontrollers through python, start here: [adafruit: what is circuitpython?](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/what-is-circuitpython)
* for details on going back and forth between circuitpython and arduino, see [firmware.](https://github.com/maholli/SAM32/blob/master/firmware/readme.MD#this-board-can-be-programmed-with-arduino-or-circuitpython-default)

## Easily Add Hardware Capability

Compatibility with [Adafruit Feather Wings](https://www.adafruit.com/category/814) makes adding sound, displays, and even GPS a breeze for the SAM32.
